# Cassia's Portfolio 

## Install 
- Download the website files and unzip.

[https://github.com/cassiafish/cassiascorner/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/cassiafish/cassiascorner/archive/master.zip)

## View
Open ```public/index.html``` in your browser.

## Dependencies (only needed if you are going to modify and compile the site).
Download and install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/).
Then run the following in the website's folder:
```bash
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
grunt
```

## Modify
- CSS styles (sass) assets/css/styles.scss
- JS assets/js/scripts.js
- HTML public/index.html

Run ```grunt``` after to compile.

## Compiled files
- CSS public/css/styles.css
- JS public/js/app.min.js

## What to do if compiling is too difficult?
Node.js and grunt can be a pain in the ass to install. Therefore, I have included the latests compiled files. 
The website will work right out the the box. You can even modify the compiled files by hand (it may be difficult..).
